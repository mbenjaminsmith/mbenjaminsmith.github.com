title: "[DRAFT] Moai is Great Haxe May be Better"
---

<p>I've been talking a lot about how good <a href="http://getmoai.com" title="Moai">Moai</a> is, even compared to the quirky but successful Unity3D game engine. Moai is billed as a game engine for professional developers and that sums it up pretty well. It's designed by people who make games and are good programmers. It's a pleasure to use and the use of Lua makes prototyping fast.</p>

<p>Moai is a great cross-platform game engine, but ulimately I think it's not cross-platform enough. This isn't an implementation problem since it was always meant to focus on the two main mobile platforms. A couple years ago that may have even been a sane design decision but now I think it's a bad bet for a game company.</p>

<p>Haxe is a technology that I came across a couple of years ago but didn't give much thought to. At the time (and when I did some hardcore engine shopping last year) I thought platforms like Flash and the more "obscure" mobile/touch platforms (like Kindle) were not a priority. I recently looked at it again much more seriously and have been very impressed with what I've found.</p>

<p>More soon...</p>
