<a href="http://altdevblogaday.com/2011/12/17/why-on-earth-would-we-write-our-own-game-engine/">Writing vs Buying a Game Engine</a><br/><p><span>In the <a href="http://altdevblogaday.com/2011/12/17/why-on-earth-would-we-write-our-own-game-engine/" target="_blank">linked post</a> Yossarian </span><span><span><span>King</span></span></span><span>, a 15 year veteran of Electronic Arts, talks about his decision making process while helping to found Blackbird Interactive, a social games startup in Vancouver. He outlines how his team determined whether or not to buy or build an engine for their startup. The short of it is that they could find very little reason to write one in-house. The full post is worth a read.</span></p>

<p>We recently went through this decision making process ourselves. We&#8217;re currently focusing on mobile (iOS) games and found that <a href="http://www.cocos2d-iphone.org/" target="_blank">Cocos2D</a> beat out <a href="http://unity3d.com/" target="_blank">Unity</a> for us. It wasn&#8217;t about the cost. Unity is very affordable. It was mostly the desire not to develop in C++ (correction: that&#8217;s actually C#, UnityScript (JavaScript) or Boo (Python)) when only Objective-C is needed and because we&#8217;re looking at developing 2D and 2.5D games and don&#8217;t currently have any need for 3D. Unity <em>might</em> be a decent choice for iOS-only, 2.5D games, but I didn&#8217;t see that argument made compellingly enough.</p>

<p>One of the things we used to inform our decision was spending a couple of days working through most of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Learning-iOS-Game-Programming-Hands/dp/0321699424" target="_blank">Learning iOS Game Programming by Michael Daley</a> (that&#8217;s not an affiliate link or anything, just linking as a courtesy). He builds a very simple game engine step by step in the book and it was really helpful for understanding what we&#8217;re getting with a mature game engine.</p>

<p>We came to the same conclusion of course - there&#8217;s absolutely no reason to reinvent the wheel when starting a games company. We&#8217;re not 100% sure that we&#8217;ll stick with Cocos2D, but it currently looks like a good choice.</p>
