    <h1>The Name Change</h1>
    <p>GameSmith is now RapidFire Studio.</p>

<p>And now, an explanation:</p>

<p>RapidFire is my third company. I&#8217;ve been an entrepreneur since my mid-20s and have never had a company I started fail. I&#8217;ve had my share of individual projects fail but never a company that I had committed to.</p>

<p>My first company was bricks and mortar (a PR agency). We carried heavy staffing requirements and had an 18-month sales cycle (seriously). We were also majority foreign owned and therefore could not qualify for bank financing. It was a grind to say the least. Still, I didn&#8217;t give up on it and when I left the company (in the hands of my partners) to follow further dreams it was an established company turning a healthy profit. It still is today.</p>

<p>Next I started a software company that took a couple of years to really gain any traction. That isn&#8217;t because tech is slow &#8212; it was the fact that I had to start from scratch. I had to learn how to program, for one. My girlfriend (now wife) and I moved into a studio apartment to cut our expenses and I vowed I wouldn&#8217;t leave it until I had built a successful software company. I worked 16 hours a day for nearly two years until I could build my own software and also understood the market enough to sell it. To cap that period off we got married and moved into a spacious luxury condo about a year ago. Tough times followed by happy times.</p>

<p>So, back to failure:</p>

<p>One of the most powerful skills an entrepreneur can develop is knowing when to quit. It&#8217;s critical to be able to push though something no matter what. It&#8217;s also critical to know when to abandon things.</p>

<p>We recently talked about re-writing RapidFire&#8217;s first game on this blog. Since then we&#8217;ve actually rewritten that rewrite. Why? I don&#8217;t expect us to take over the world with our first game but I do expect that game to be fun. And I made the decision in our first six months here (will be six next month) that delays at the beginning are acceptable if the results are worth it.</p>

<p>Why add risk to risk by rewriting a game? Because the feedback on the first versions wasn&#8217;t strong enough. People thought it was interesting and some of the physics-based action was pretty cool, but I could tell there was no real click.</p>

<p>So we decided to rewrite it again. The new idea, which we&#8217;ll start talking about pretty soon, I feel is the right one. The people that I&#8217;ve discussed it with think it&#8217;s a fun idea. Most importantly, I think it&#8217;s a fun idea. It has that strange quality of being a new idea &#8212; going in a direction we hadn&#8217;t considered before &#8212; but feeling like the idea we were supposed to be making all along. Development is moving rapidly now and we&#8217;re still trying to get it out by mid-year. I&#8217;m confident we&#8217;ll make that target.</p>

<p>What does this have to do with our new name? </p>

<p>I felt the same way about our name as I did about early versions of our first game. People would respond &#8220;ah, ok&#8221;. I got lots of &#8220;ah, ok&#8217;s&#8221;. And as much as I wanted to stick with GameSmith for the sake of consistency and not giving up on something, I decided to pivot with our name as well. </p>

<p>I think it&#8217;s a sane choice. This company is very young, we&#8217;re barely known yet, and sorting out hiccups early on will give us a better foundation in the years to follow.</p>

<p>So there it is: a new name, a new (re-)revised game and our absolute determination to accomplish what we&#8217;ve set out to do.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ll have updates on the game soon.</p>
