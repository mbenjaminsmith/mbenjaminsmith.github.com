This is the first video made after moving to the Unity 3D game engine. This shows the mockup UI and a few of the early ship models from our 3D girl. (The largest model was downloaded without restriction from a 3D model website and won&#8217;t appear in the final game.) It also shows background rendered by one of Allegorithmic&#8217;s substances (dynamic textures).</span><br/><br/><span>Background music courtesy miii -Â </span><a href="http://www.jamendo.com/en/artist/miii" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">jamendo.com/en/artist/miii</a></p>
