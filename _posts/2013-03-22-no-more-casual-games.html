title: "Why We're Not Going to Make Casual Games"
---

<p>We (I mean the royal we since I'm still bootstrapping this company with only myself and the occasional freelancer) have decided to stop working on casual games.</p>

<p>Why? The short answer is I hate casual games. The long answer is I hate casual games, the design of casual games and the marketing of casual games.</p> 

<p>The casual game industry is attractive in a lot of ways. The games are usually a lot simpler because player expectations (and sophistication, gaming literacy) are a lot lower. Art and content is generally cheaper to produce as there is a lot less of it and device/player capabilities are towards the bottom end of the spectrum.</p>

<p>My main issue with casual games is that *I simply do not like to play them*. It's really difficult (nay, impossible) for me to design something that I have no intention of playing myself. That might seem obvious, but I was trying to balance my desire to make games with my desire to provide well for myself and my family.</p>

<p>So, after a year of (ultimately shelved) casual games, I've said fuck it and decided to devote my time to making games that I want to play. Is that a bad decision? My gut (and I do have nearly a decade of entrepreneurship and two successful companies under my belt) says absolutely not.</p>

<p>So that's the good news. The bad new is, well, there isn't any.</p>

<p>Oh, and yes there is a new game underway. It's a hunting/crafting/survival game set on a volcanic archipelago with a strong female lead as our protagonist. I'll be posting more about it here soon and will be updating our YouTube channel with development videos.</p>
