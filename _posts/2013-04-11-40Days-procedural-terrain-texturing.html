title: "40Days Procedural Terrain Texturing"

<p>This is a simple but high quality replacement for Unity 4's built in terrain system that I put together for our upcoming game 40Days. This uses meshes (made in a 3D modelling program) as opposed to heightmaps and uses a rule-based procedural shader instead of splatmaps. The shader uses world position instead of UV coordinates for texturing -- completely separating the modelling and texturing aspects of terrain creation.</p>

<p>The result is a very powerful, easy to tweak system for developing organic looking terrain quickly. Terrains don't have to be painted by hand and can be updated without having to have their texturing or UVs retouched.</p>
