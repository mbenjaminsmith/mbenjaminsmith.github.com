title: The Game Change
---

<p>When I started GameSmith I decided that we would build the company around a few simple ideas: quality, fun and originality. The first two are expected. If you want to make successful games they absolutely have to be fun and if you&#8217;re not ripping off your customers they should be made to high standards. The third idea is somewhat optional in game development.</p>

<p>The game industry seems to echo the film industry when it comes to originality. Original creations appear and often find financial success, but a large percentage of the industry focuses on the creation of sequels, clones and makeovers of tried and true concepts. </p>

<p>Creating something that&#8217;s original is risky. You don&#8217;t have a solid roadmap to follow. Knowing if your idea has legs is hundreds or thousands of hours of development time (and money) away. We learned this the hard way when our original idea (a simplified, almost tower-defense like RTS game) reached baroque levels of complication trying to make it fun. In order to keep scope reasonable we tried to build a very simple RTS game. In the process we threw out most of the elements that make an RTS game fun.</p>

<p>We then had two choices: increase scope and add more RTS elements or change the main gameplay to something else. We knew we didn&#8217;t want to make an already growing project larger so we decided to pivot.</p>

<p>The most manageable game style we could come up with that allowed to keep our original story was that of a lone fighter crossing the galaxy. It would be top-scrolling and have very simple controls. We also thought a space shooter would be fun provided we could give it enough unique elements as well as keep the original depth of story we had planned.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re now a couple of months into this new idea and it is taking shape. A few highlights are:</p>

<p>1. Simple, arcade style controls. Four-button platformers were fun so why don&#8217;t we keep our touchscreen controls simple? Too many otherwise attractive games fail miserably when it comes to virtualized controls.</p>

<p>2. Interactive dialog. Relationships matter (especially with your co-pilot). Character matters. Who you are does effect the outcome. </p>

<p><strike>3. No DLC, IAP or other bait-and-switch crap.</strike></p>

<p><strike>4. High price. No, really. Games are expensive to make. We want to make games that are not compromised by monetization strategies (see #3 above). That means we have to charge. We&#8217;re probably talking under US $10, but certainly not &#8220;freemium&#8221; or $0.99.</strike></p>

<p>Update (August 27, 2012):</p>

<p>This post was written a while ago but had been sticking in my brain. Items #3 and #4 above were wrong. DLC and IAP (and F2P) are not &#8220;bait-and-switch crap&#8221;, they&#8217;re effective ways to get games in front of as many players as possible while generating revenue. Ongoing monetization via unlockable features and content are an excellent way to generate revenue without running ads (not that there is anything wrong with ads either, though they often do have an aesthetic impact).</p>
