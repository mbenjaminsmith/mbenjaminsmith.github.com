title: The Role of Path in Tower Defense Games
---

<p>If you&#8217;re making iOS and Android games it&#8217;s hard to overlook the success of Tower Defense games on these platforms. It&#8217;s not hard to understand why. TD games offer focused, puzzle-like strategy with very easy to learn controls and mechanics. They fit well with mobile devices&#8217; awkward input and the short attention span of mobile play. They&#8217;re strategic, but stripped down versions of their RTS big brothers. I like to call them &#8220;RTS games on rails.&#8221; The rail of course being the path.</p>

<p>Most TD games have a path. The path can be fixed or user-defined. The path can be series or parallel. There can be one or many in a level. Fixed paths are most often curving and looping corridors that stretch from one side of the screen to another. Player-defined paths emerge from tower placement combined with enemy AI. Paths are varied but their roles are constant: to define attack range and attack time for the player. Most importantly they define your enemies&#8217; goal, the consequence of the player&#8217;s defensive failures and the loss condition for the game.</p>

<p>I think that&#8217;s a large part of the reason TD games fare so well as casual games. The player has immediate feedback on the consequences of bad strategy. Don&#8217;t shoot the bad guys enough times and they happily enter your little doorway of demise. Conversely winning is also clearly defined. Shoot the bad guys enough times and they&#8217;re no longer a threat. Enemies getting harder to kill? Add more guns or upgrade the ones you already have.</p>

<p>The best TD games allow path to define gameplay. I think geoDefense is one of the best examples. Different weapons are more effective based on where they are placed in relation to path. Lasers are most efficient when placed adjacent to long straight path segments (they can shoot through long rows of enemies). Machine guns are most efficient in curves or loops (limited range but very high rate of fire).</p>

<p>The weaker TD games (like TowerDefense) have an ill defined relationship between path and weapons. Gun tower or sniper tower? Just buy the one with the cooler animation.</p>

<p>Games misuse path at the expense of gameplay. The hit Plants vs Zombies is a good example. While a parallel path is innovative, it breaks the relationship between path and weapons strategy. Which weapons to choose? Where to place them? Doesn&#8217;t really matter - just make sure every path has something in it.</p>

<p>The game my company is currently working is forcing us to think very critically about the role of path. We want to innovate and while keeping the well defined, focused gameplay of a rigid-path TD game, we want to &#8212; gasp &#8212; eliminate the path entirely. Why be so foolish? We want the focus without the aesthetics. We want our game to feel like a space RTS or even shooter, but we want to keep the on-rails gameplay of TD.</p>

<p>The development of this core mechanic is running in parallel with most of the other development. In an ideal world we would have settled on this first, but sorting out this aspect of gameplay is hard as well as time consuming. We&#8217;ve pushed ahead developing as much of the game as we can safely knowing the game as a whole is still in flux.</p>

<p>But we&#8217;ve recently had a breakthrough. This whole time we&#8217;ve been searching for a way to stick an invisible path in a game that doesn&#8217;t have room for one. But then it occurred to us that a path that can be understood as space can also be understood as time. Like a micro-Einstein moment we realized we could swap time for space and create &#8212; ta da &#8212; a dimension-less path.</p>

<p>The trick of course is to now represent time as clearly as a path does. We have some ideas on this that&#8217;ll we&#8217;ll be testing in the next few days. We do have graphical ways for representing time clearly - pie graphs, clock animations, even numbered countdown timers. We&#8217;re thinking that we can apply these elements to represent the amount of time before an enemy does damage.</p>

<p>A path is a way to visualize the time you have to eliminate an enemy before it hurts you. But you could take the enemy out of the path and give it a clock. These are equivalent. Making that mechanic clear and fitting it into overall gameplay (aesthetically and mechanically) is certainly a challenge, but what we believe is a worthwhile one. We&#8217;ll see how it goes. We&#8217;re feeling pretty Zen tackling the path-less path. We&#8217;re hoping that it gives the sort of focus to our game that makes TD games so compelling as casual games.</p>
