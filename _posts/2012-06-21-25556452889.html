title: Untitled Game Mega Screenshot Update
---

<p>I haven&#8217;t put out any information about our upcoming game since we finalized the (new, updated) concept. We&#8217;re in heavy development now and are still planning on having this game in testing by the end of the month.</p>

<p>The following screenshots outline a lot of the basic gameplay. Combat is getting finalized now, so there are only a few shots of combat available. Most importantly, combat will include physics-engine driven homing missiles, flare countermeasures and other interesting bits flying around the screen.</p>

<p>What is this game? To save a dying civilization, you have to cross the known galaxy. I want to call it a space-trekking game. Space is a big element in the game. You need to find resources (and other goodies) without being found &#8212; or at least being found as little as possible. There are no RPG elements here. Combat does not increase your abilities or weapon capabilities. Like in the real world, combat uses up valuable ammunition and gets your ship damaged. There are only a few places in the known galaxy to get your ship repaired and supplies replenished, so avoiding combat is just as important as getting good at it. There&#8217;s a heavy simulation element to the game. It asks the question: what would happen if I needed to warp across a hostile galaxy with a single ship, limited resources and virtually no allies.</p>
