<p>This is an update for the development of the environment for 40Days. We're talking about improvements made to our procedural/tri-planar terrain shader that make the results look hand painted. We're also talking about moving from billboarded grass and leaves to modeled/opaque grass and leaves for a major performance gain.</p>
